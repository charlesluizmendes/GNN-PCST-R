# GNN-PCST-R

Using Graph Neural Networks to optimize weights in the Prize Collecting Steiner Tree algorithm using the RADNET protocol.

## Environment

All development was performed using Python 3.12.4.

### Packages

We can install the project dependencies using the command below:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually through the following commands:

```bash
pip install ipykernel
pip install tqdm
pip install numpy
